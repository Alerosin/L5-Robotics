L5-Robotics
==============

(This README is incomplete)

This project is building a 'brain' for a robot using Cellular Automata. 

The aim is to have a robot use it to make decisions in an exploration task. It is hoped that this will lead to simpler ways of building and controlling robots.

To install:
-------------

You'll need an installation of Ubuntu and ROS, with catkin.

 - 1. Clone, or download and unzip into a catkin workspace.
 - 2. In a terminal, got to the catkin workspace and enter:  
           catkin_make
 - 3. Now launch one of the launch files in l5_robots/launch/  
           roslaunch l5_robots name_of_launch_file.launch
